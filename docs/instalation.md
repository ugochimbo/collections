# Instalation

The recommended way to install Collections is with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org). Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP that allows you to declare the dependencies your project needs and installs them into your project.

```bash
composer require easyframework/collections
```

You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and other best-practices for defining dependencies at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org).
